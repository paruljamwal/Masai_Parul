    <h1>React Components</h1>
    <p>React is a component based UI library</p>
    <p>helps to create single page websites</p>
    <ul>Components are of two types</ul>
    <li>Functional component</li>
    <li>Class components</li>
    <h3>Components always return something like JSX </h3>
    <p>Each  Components  have their own life cycle</p>
     <p>Components make the code reusable</p>
     <p>We can send data to another components as well</p>
     <p>In Functional components we can use hooks by using hooks we can do all work which we are doing by class components</p>
     <p>Before introducing hooks functional components are stateless components</p>
     <p>We have states to change the states of components and we can pass value to another components by using props </p>
      <p>state act as memory of the components</p>
      <p>componet always return something like JSX</p>
      <p> Main diffenence between class and functional componets are class component internally also convert to functional components</p>
      <p>So , in functional component we can say that they are fast as comparison to class components</p>
      <p>functional componets syntex is simple it gives cleaner code easy to understand</p>
