# context api....
1. suppose we have a nested herireracky eg. 
   
    A  - parent
    B  - child B
    C  - child C
    D  - child D 

and we have to pass data from parent A to child D .. 

Now :-
    we have three approches to solve these problems..

    1. we can send data deep down to every child as a prop.. 
    but by using this way we send data to those childs as well they don't have 
    any need to this data. so this is a wastage of time as well as memory....

    2. we can use context Api for this problem as well. context Api is like a seperate store
    its like a provider and consumer . we can make one component as a data provider. 
    and where you want to use these data you can get data provider their only you have to
    wrap your data by using this provider..
